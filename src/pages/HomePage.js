//TODO LIST!
//1. Click the name label and then re arange our state array alphabetically
  // just how u did a onchange with a helper bunction - this time on on click with a helper function
  // inside on on click helper you will sort the array alphabetically!! and then update the state
    // similar to hwo you did it on the filter but this time we are just sorting abc order

// 2. Fill out each emp html thats getting displayed - fill it up with h1s for email name phone ect... make look nice!

// 3. GH pages react deploy
